# gist
The idea of these samples to provide an easy to understand example.
By means of:  
• keep samples as small as possible but still big enough to frame the core idea.  
• the data domain is bound to everydays items, no movie/gender/hobby specific.  
• code is ready to go, all you need are Java & Maven  
• structured in a fancy package tree  
• Overall code quality is not a goal. For example - there are lots of duplication.
Pieces of code are not reused across the most examples to focus on only one idea per sample.  
• No softare examples
